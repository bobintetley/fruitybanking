<h2>Fruity Banking!</h2>

<p>Fruity Banking is a web-based personal finance system based on double-entry
   accounting methods.</p>

<p>You create accounts, which can represent "real" accounts (such as credit cards,
   bank accounts, etc.) and "nominal" accounts (expense and income accounts).</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with double entry accounting, the basic idea is that
   money cannot simply appear or disappear, every single transaction
   has two sides - a source and destination account. You take money from one
   and put it into the other.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Say, I have a bank account called "Current" and a nominal expense account
   called "House Expenses". I could go to the shops and spend 48 pounds on
   shopping against my debit card. I log this by taking the
   money I spent from the "Current" account (decrementing the amount of
   money I have in there) and putting it into the "House Expenses" account.
   We do this by logging a withdrawal against the current account with the
   house expenses as the destination on the transaction screen for the
   current account.</p>

<p>Because every transaction has two sides, after I log that transaction, I
   could view the house expenses account and the transaction would appear
   as a deposit in there.</p>

<p>By sourcing money from nominal accounts in this way, you can track how
   much you've spent on different items!</p>

<h2>Reconciliation</h2>

<p>Whilst viewing any account, if you have a statement to show real
   transactions, you can follow the reconciliation link to mark the transaction
   as reconciled against the statement.</p>

<h2>Go play!</h2>

<p>It's easy - have fun!</p>
